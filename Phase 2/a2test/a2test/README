Test driver for Assignment 2 BigQ Milestone 1 (spring 2011 dbi) 

This test driver gives a menu-based interface to three options that allows you
to test your code:

	1. sort
	2. sort + display
	3. sort + write

Note that the driver works only with heap dbfiles created over tpch tables.
Before using the driver, make sure you have generated the necessary heap dbfiles
(you can use test driver 1 to generate the heap dbfiles. For your convenience a
copy of test driver 1 is included along with this driver. Look at files
a1-README, and a1-test.cc)

To compile the driver, type
	make test.out

To run the driver, type
	test.out
and follow the on-screen instructions.

Using the driver:
==================

1. SETTINGS: The following variables control the various file locations and they
are declared in test.h:
	o dbfile_dir -- this is where the driver can locate the binary heap
dbfiles. The driver assumes that the dbfiles have the extension '.bin'.  By
default, this is set to "" (thus all the heap dbfiles should be locatable in the
same directory as the test driver).

2. Next replace the stub files DBFile.h, DBFile.cc, BigQ.h, and BigQ.cc with your
own code. If you are using additional headers, modify the Makefile to include
them as well. Then compile and execute the driver and follow the on-screen
instructions.

3. You will be asked to enter the sort ordering that is to be passed on to the
BigQ constructor. You will need to enter the sort ordering as a CNF with only one
literal per clause. The literal must be a valid attribute name for the selected
relation. The test driver will construct a ordermaker instance to be passed on to
the BigQ constructor. Some examples are provided below. Note that to use this
feature, you need to use the new version of the files Parse.y and Comparison.cc
provided in this driver.

CNF examples to specify sort order:
===================================

dbfile      |  sortby                                  |  CNF
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
region      |  r_name 	 	                       | (r_name)
       
partsupp    |  ps_suppkey, ps_partkey 		       | (ps_suppkey) AND (ps_partkey)

lineitem    |  l_shipdate, l_extendedprice, l_quantity | (l_shipdate) AND 
							 (l_extendedprice) AND 
							 (l_quantity)

How the driver works:
=====================

Once a heap dbfile is selected and a CNF is specified for the sort order, the
test driver sets up an input and an output pipe and passes them off to the BigQ
constructor along with an ordermaker instance created from the supplied CNF. The
test driver then creates two threads:
	-a producer thread that feeds data into the input pipe by repeatedly
reading records off from the supplied heap dbfile. The producer thread shuts down
the input pipe when it has finished dumping all the records from the input dbfile
	-a consumer thread that repeatedly reads data off from the output pipe
and verifies that the data is in the correct sorted order (as encoded in the
ordermaker instance passed off to BigQ).

options:
========
1. sort -- simply tells how many records were inserted into the input pipe and
how many were received by the output pipe and if they were in the correct sorted
order

2. sort + display -- gives the same information but also prints the records
received off the output pipe on to the standard output

3. sort + write -- dumps the records received from the output pipe into a heap
dbfile (with the extension bigq)

Submission Instructions: 
========================= 

Same as a1 (Instead of creating directory a1, create directory a2. The turnin
file should be called a2.tar.gz)
