readme 
=========

this driver is for milestone 2 of the assignment 2

To compile the driver, type
	make test.out

To run the driver, type
	test.out
and follow the on-screen instructions.

Using the driver:
==================

1. SETTINGS: The following variables control the various file locations and they
are declared in test.h:
	o dbfile_dir -- this is where the driver can locate the binary heap
dbfiles. The driver assumes that the dbfiles have the extension '.bin'.  By
default, this is set to "" (thus all the heap dbfiles should be locatable in the
same directory as the test driver).

IMPORTANT: All additional files that you create (metadata and other things) 
should be stored in the location specified by dbfile_dir.Donot hard code 
specific paths into your files.Always use the dbfile_dir variable to 
determine the location to store additional files.

2. Next replace the stub files DBFile.h, DBFile.cc, BigQ.h, and BigQ.cc with your
own code. If you are using additional headers, modify the Makefile to include
them as well. Then compile and execute the driver and follow the on-screen
instructions.

Submission Instructions: 
========================= 

Same as a2 (Instead of creating directory a2, create directory a2-2. The turnin
file should be called a2-2.tar.gz)
The executable produced by your file should be called a22.out
